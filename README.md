# College Search Tester

This project was created in Node.js using Cucumber and Selenium. I did this to familiarize myself with testing technologies in a meaningful way. This program will search the University of Wisconsin Green Bay's website for keywords such as "Computer Science" or "School of Business" and searches the page for the key text. The program then provides the results of a successful or failed test.
